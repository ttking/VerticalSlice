# VerticalSlice
a vertical slice of Child of Light

This was a school project where our goal was to remake a scene in Child of Light, in particular a battle scene.
It is all made in Unity with C# with 3 developers and 3 artists, in this project i mostly did documentation and made sure everyone had a task to do.
For programming i helped all round by helping the other developers find a solution for things they couldnt figure out at that moment.
